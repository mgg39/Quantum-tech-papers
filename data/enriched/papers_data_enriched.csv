"A Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms - John M. Martyn, Zane M. Rossi, Andrew K. Tan, Isaac L. Chuang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02859,,A Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms,"Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical
counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this
advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation,
and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of
composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were
recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation
of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In
the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC
2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification,
methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here,
we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first
illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum
eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19,
we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase
estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the
eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates
how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms,
thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.","John M. Martyn, Zane M. Rossi, Andrew K. Tan, Isaac L. Chuang",arXiv,quant-ph
A photonic cluster state machine gun,https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2587,Quantum Photonics,A photonic cluster state machine gun,"We present a method to convert certain single photon sources into devices
capable of emitting large strings of photonic cluster state in a controlled and
pulsed ""on demand"" manner. Such sources would greatly reduce the resources
required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors,
such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a
time. This allows for the use of standard fault tolerance techniques, and shows
that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using
realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high
entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per
photon of less than 0.2%. For quantum dot sources the method has the added
advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons
from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.","Netanel H. Lindner, Terry Rudolph",arXiv,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall"
"A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in quantum networks - Matheus Guedes de Andrade, Wenhan Dai, Saikat Guha, Don Towsley",https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09839,,"A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in
  quantum networks","Quantum networks are complex systems formed by the interaction among quantum
processors through quantum channels. Analogous to classical computer networks,
quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among
quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform
distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum
walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We
consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that
accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network
graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically
captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and
the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal
transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the
network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers
are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use
the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows
the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.
Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in
a quantum network.","Matheus Guedes de Andrade, Wenhan Dai, Saikat Guha, Don Towsley",arXiv,quant-ph

"All-photonic quantum repeaters - Koji Azuma, Kiyoshi Tamaki & Hoi-Kwong Lo",https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7207,,All photonic quantum repeaters,"Quantum communication holds promise for unconditionally secure transmission
of secret messages and faithful transfer of unknown quantum states. Photons
appear to be the medium of choice for quantum communication. Owing to photon
losses, robust quantum communication over long lossy channels requires quantum
repeaters. It is widely believed that a necessary and highly demanding
requirement for quantum repeaters is the existence of matter quantum memories
at the repeater nodes. Here we show that such a requirement is, in fact,
unnecessary by introducing the concept of all photonic quantum repeaters based
on flying qubits. As an example of the realization of this concept, we present
a protocol based on photonic cluster state machine guns and a loss-tolerant
measurement equipped with local high-speed active feedforwards. We show that,
with such an all photonic quantum repeater, the communication efficiency still
scales polynomially with the channel distance. Our result paves a new route
toward quantum repeaters with efficient single-photon sources rather than
matter quantum memories.","Koji Azuma, Kiyoshi Tamaki, Hoi-Kwong Lo",arXiv,quant-ph
"An Architecture for Meeting Quality-of-Service Requirements in Multi-User Quantum Networks - Matthew Skrzypczyk, Stephanie Wehner",https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13124,,"An Architecture for Meeting Quality-of-Service Requirements in
  Multi-User Quantum Networks","Quantum communication can enhance internet technology by enabling novel
applications that are provably impossible classically. The successful execution
of such applications relies on the generation of quantum entanglement between
different users of the network which meets stringent performance requirements.
Alongside traditional metrics such as throughput and jitter, one must ensure
the generated entanglement is of sufficiently high quality. Meeting such
performance requirements demands a careful orchestration of many devices in the
network, giving rise to a fundamentally new scheduling problem. Furthermore,
technological limitations of near-term quantum devices impose significant
constraints on scheduling methods hoping to meet performance requirements. In
this work, we propose the first end-to-end design of a centralized quantum
network with multiple users that orchestrates the delivery of entanglement
which meets quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of applications. We achieve
this by using a centrally constructed schedule that manages usage of devices
and ensures the coordinated execution of different quantum operations
throughout the network. We use periodic task scheduling and
resource-constrained project scheduling techniques, including a novel
heuristic, to construct the schedules. Our simulations of four small networks
using hardware-validated network parameters, and of a real-world fiber topology
using futuristic parameters, illustrate trade-offs between traditional and
quantum performance metrics.","Matthew Skrzypczyk, Stephanie Wehner",arXiv,"quant-ph, cs.NI"

circuits over multiple agents, minimising quantum communication between them.
We reduce the problem to hypergraph partitioning and then solve it with
state-of-the-art optimisers. This makes our approach useful in practice, unlike

Blueprint for a Scalable Photonic Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02905,Quantum Photonics,Blueprint for a Scalable Photonic Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer,"Photonics is the platform of choice to build a modular, easy-to-network
quantum computer operating at room temperature. However, no concrete
architecture has been presented so far that exploits both the advantages of
qubits encoded into states of light and the modern tools for their generation.
Here we propose such a design for a scalable and fault-tolerant photonic
quantum computer informed by the latest developments in theory and technology.
Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of
three-dimensional hybrid resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and
squeezed vacuum states. The proposal enables exploiting state-of-the-art
procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with
the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the
implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states.
Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic
chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial
dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing
architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design
opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics
to leap-frog other platforms on the path to a quantum computer with millions of
qubits.","J. Eli Bourassa, Rafael N. Alexander, Michael Vasmer, Ashlesha Patil, Ilan Tzitrin, Takaya Matsuura, Daiqin Su, Ben Q. Baragiola, Saikat Guha, Guillaume Dauphinais, Krishna K. Sabapathy, Nicolas C. Menicucci, Ish Dhand",arXiv,quant-ph

employing state-of-art quantum subroutines including the quantum SWAP test and
quantum amplitude amplification, we show how a quadratic speedup can be
obtained over the classical algorithm, in principle. Utilization of quantum
computation also allows the algorithm to match -- at little additional
computational cost -- full density matrices at fragment boundaries, instead of
being limited to 1-RDMs. Current quantum computers are small, but quantum
bootstrap embedding provides a potentially generalizable strategy for
harnessing such small machines through quantum fragment matching.","Yuan Liu, Oinam R. Meitei, Zachary E. Chin, Arkopal Dutt, Max Tao, Isaac L. Chuang, Troy Van Voorhis",arXiv,"quant-ph, physics.chem-ph"

"Comparing coherent and incoherent models for quantum homogenization - Anna Beever, Maria Violaris, Chiara Marletto, and Vlatko Vedral",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15741.pdf,,Comparing coherent and incoherent models for quantum homogenization,"Here we investigate the role of quantum interference in the quantum
homogenizer, whose convergence properties model a thermalization process. In
the original quantum homogenizer protocol, a system qubit converges to the
state of identical reservoir qubits through partial-swap interactions, that
allow interference between reservoir qubits. We design an alternative,
incoherent quantum homogenizer, where each system-reservoir interaction is
moderated by a control qubit using a controlled-swap interaction. We show that
our incoherent homogenizer satisfies the essential conditions for
homogenization, being able to transform a qubit from any state to any other
state to arbitrary accuracy, with negligible impact on the reservoir qubits'
states. Our results show that the convergence properties of homogenization
machines that are important for modelling thermalization are not dependent on
coherence between qubits in the homogenization protocol. We then derive bounds
on the resources required to re-use the homogenizers for performing state
transformations. This demonstrates that both homogenizers are universal for any
number of homogenizations, for an increased resource cost.","Anna Beever, Maria Violaris, Chiara Marletto, Vlatko Vedral",arXiv,quant-ph

physics that are directly about information, independently of the details of
particular physical instantiations, it does not regard information as an a
priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and
properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. It does not suffer from
the circularity at the foundations of existing information theory (namely that
information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other). It
explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and
reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most
distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of
in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning,
the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp
values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and

Constructor Theory of Life - Chiara Marletto,https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0681,,Constructor Theory of Life,"Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory explains how the appearance of purposive
design in the sophisticated adaptations of living organisms can have come about
without their intentionally being designed. The explanation relies crucially on
the possibility of certain physical processes: mainly, gene replication and
natural selection. In this paper I show that for those processes to be possible
without the design of biological adaptations being encoded in the laws of
physics, those laws must have certain other properties. The theory of what
these properties are is not part of evolution theory proper, and has not been
developed, yet without it the neo-Darwinian theory does not fully achieve its
purpose of explaining the appearance of design. To this end I apply Constructor
Theory's new mode of explanation to provide an exact formulation of the
appearance of design, of no-design laws, and of the logic of self-reproduction
and natural selection, within fundamental physics. I conclude that
self-reproduction, replication and natural selection are possible under
no-design laws, the only non-trivial condition being that they allow digital
information to be physically instantiated. This has an exact characterisation
in the constructor theory of information. I also show that under no-design laws

so-called 'decision-theoretic approach' (Deutsch, 1999; Wallace, 2003, 2007,
2012), I shall recast that problem in the recently proposed constructor theory
of information - where quantum theory is represented as one of a class of
superinformation theories, which are local, non-probabilistic theories
conforming to certain constructor-theoretic conditions. I prove that the
unpredictability of measurement outcomes (to which I give an exact meaning via
constructor theory), necessarily arises in superinformation theories. Then I
explain how the appearance of stochasticity in (finitely many) repeated
measurements can arise under superinformation theories. And I establish
sufficient conditions for a superinformation theory to inform decisions (made
under it) as if it were probabilistic, via a Deutsch-Wallace-type argument -
thus defining a class of decision-supporting superinformation theories. This
broadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover
constructor-theory compliant theories. In addition, in this version some of the

expectation values, macroscopic limits, infinite heat baths, etc., not with the
details of physical variables of individual microscopic systems. They are
consistent with the laws of motion for finite systems only in certain
approximations, which improve with increasing scale, given various assumptions
about initial conditions which are neither specified precisely nor even thought
to hold exactly in nature. Here I propose a new formulation of the zeroth,
first and second laws, improving upon the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics
(Carath\'eodory, 1909; Lieb & Yngvason, 1999), via the principles of the
recently proposed constructor theory. Specifically, I provide a
non-approximative, scale-independent formulation of 'adiabatic accessibility';
this in turn provides a non-approximative, scale-independent distinction
between work and heat and reveals an unexpected connection between information
theory and the first law of thermodynamics (not just the second). It also

curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up

or mitigation indispensable for quantum computation. While current
error-correcting strategies focus on correcting errors in quantum states or
quantum gates, these fine-grained error-correction methods can incur
significant overhead for quantum algorithms of increasing complexity. We
present a first step in achieving error correction at the level of quantum
algorithms by combining a unified perspective on modern quantum algorithms via
quantum signal processing (QSP). An error model of under- or over-rotation of
the signal processing operator parameterized by $\epsilon < 1$ is introduced.
It is shown that while Pauli $Z$-errors are not recoverable without additional
resources, Pauli $X$ and $Y$ errors can be arbitrarily suppressed by coherently
appending a noisy `recovery QSP.' Furthermore, it is found that a recovery QSP
of length $O(2^k c^{k^2} d)$ is sufficient to correct any length-$d$ QSP with
$c$ unique phases to $k^{th}$-order in error $\epsilon$. Allowing an additional
assumption, a lower bound of $\Omega(cd)$ is shown, which is tight for $k = 1$,
on the length of the recovery sequence. Our algorithmic-level error correction
method is applied to Grover's fixed-point search algorithm as a demonstration.","Andrew K. Tan, Yuan Liu, Minh C. Tran, Isaac L. Chuang",arXiv,quant-ph

friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide
references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning
mathematical generality.
  We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ
canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most
notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to
combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with
simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on
quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally
QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast
to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.
  Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work
with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the
same advantage.
  Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model
interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of
categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus
translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the
circuit variables to be learned.
  Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a
novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current
standards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of

Fundamental Principle of Information-to-Energy Conversion - Antonio Alfonso-Faus,https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6052,,Fundamental Principle of Information-to-Energy Conversion,"The equivalence of 1 bit of information to entropy was given by Landauer in
1961 as kln2, k the Boltzmann constant. Erasing information implies heat
dissipation and the energy of 1 bit would then be (the Landauers limit) kT ln
2, T being the ambient temperature. From a quantum-cosmological point of view
the minimum quantum of energy in the universe corresponds today to a
temperature of 10^(-29) degrees K, probably forming a cosmic background of a
Bose condensate [1]. Then, the bit with minimum energy today in the Universe is
a quantum of energy 10^(-45)ergs, with an equivalent mass of 10^(-66)g. Low
temperature implies low energy per bit and, of course, this is the way for
faster and less energy dissipating computing devices. Our conjecture is this:

arises in certain physical systems for quantum computing, such as photonics.
FBQC can offer significant architectural simplifications, enabling hardware
made up of many identical modules, requiring an extremely low depth of
operations on each physical qubit and reducing classical processing
requirements. We present two pedagogical examples of fault-tolerant schemes
constructed in this framework and numerically evaluate their threshold under a
hardware agnostic fusion error model including both erasure and Pauli error. We
also study an error model of linear optical quantum computing with
probabilistic fusion and photon loss. In FBQC the non-determinism of fusion is
directly dealt with by the quantum error correction protocol, along with other
errors. We find that tailoring the fault-tolerance framework to the physical

As an example, it considers the interaction of two charges via a mediating quantum field and the resulting interference pattern in the Lorenz gauge. Using the Heisenberg picture, it is proposed that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so‐called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge‐invariance.

assesses the performance of these methods against a set of common molecular
Hamiltonians and common states encountered during the runtime of hybrid

a classical computer through computational runtime spent in proposing
measurements and classical post-processing of acquired measurement outcomes. We
apply CSHOREBench considering a variety of measurement methods on Hamiltonians

reduces the number of measurements made by classical shadows by more than 80%,

require fewer quantum measurements along with lower classical computational
runtime than derandomization. Furthermore, CSHOREBench is empirically efficient

Our technique is based on training an artificial neural network (NN) with the measurement results obtained from experiments with simple quantum circuits consisting of singe-qubit gates only. With the NN and deep learning, non-linear noise can be corrected, which is not possible with the existing linear inversion methods.

derived in the limit of ideal devices and leave questions about the performance

how the presence of loss in repeater stations affect the maximum attainable
rates for quantum communication over linear repeater chains and more complex
quantum networks. Extending the framework of node splitting, we model the loss
introduced at the repeater stations and then prove the corresponding limits. In
the linear chain scenario we show that, by increasing the number of repeater
stations, the maximum rate cannot overcome a quantity which solely depends on
the loss of a single station. We introduce a way of adapting the standard
machinery for obtaining bounds to this realistic scenario. The difference is
that whilst ultimate limits for any strategy can be derived given a fixed
channel, when the repeaters introduce additional decoherence, then the
effective overall channel is itself a function of the chosen repeater strategy
(e.g., one-way versus two-way classical communication). Classes of repeater

the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such
a process faced an excessive generation of errors that overwhelmed the
error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically
possible to utilize QEC for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open
question. We answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected
logical qubit whose quantum coherence is significantly longer than that of all
the imperfect quantum components involved in the QEC process, beating the best
of them with a coherence gain of $G = 2.27 \pm 0.07$. We achieve this
performance by combining innovations in several domains including the
fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits and model-free reinforcement
learning.","V. V. Sivak, A. Eickbusch, B. Royer, S. Singh, I. Tsioutsios, S. Ganjam, A. Miano, B. L. Brock, A. Z. Ding, L. Frunzio, S. M. Girvin, R. J. Schoelkopf, M. H. Devoret",arXiv,quant-ph

Resource savings from fault-tolerant circuit design,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02132.pdf,Quantum Error Correction,Resource savings from fault-tolerant circuit design,"Using fault-tolerant constructions, computations performed with unreliable
components can simulate their noiseless counterparts though the introduction of
a modest amount of redundancy. Given the modest overhead required to achieve
fault-tolerance, and the fact that increasing the reliability of basic
components often comes at a cost, are there situations where fault-tolerance
may be more economical? We present a general framework to account for this
overhead cost in order to effectively compare fault-tolerant to
non-fault-tolerant approaches for computation, in the limit of small logical
error rates. Using this detailed accounting, we determine explicit boundaries
at which fault-tolerant designs become more efficient than designs that achieve
comparable reliability through direct consumption of resources. We find that
the fault-tolerant construction is always preferred in the limit of high
reliability in cases where the resources required to construct a basic unit
grows faster than $\log(1 / \epsilon)$ asymptotically for small $\epsilon$.","Andrew K. Tan, Isaac L. Chuang",arXiv,"cs.CE, cs.IT, math.IT"

gained, and we introduce a new method for decoding which uses this information
to improve performance. Applied to the subsystem toric code with three-qubit

with three-qubit check operators and optimal-depth parity-check measurement
schedules. To the best of our knowledge, these finite-rate subsystem codes
outperform all known codes at circuit-level depolarising error rates as high as
$0.2\%$, where they have a qubit overhead that is $4.3\times$ lower than the
most efficient version of the surface code and $5.1\times$ lower than the

to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes
large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A
core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the
exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable
entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement
two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the

of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced
solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and
operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set

Teleportation of entanglement over 143 km,https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0009,Quantum Entanglement & Teleportation,Teleportation of entanglement over 143 km,"As a direct consequence of the no-cloning theorem, the deterministic
amplification as in classical communication is impossible for quantum states.
This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network,
e.g. for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an
entangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource
to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement
purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater.
Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in
laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in
real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space
entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and
Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously
independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for
the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the
classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and
space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the
feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the
independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow
for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our
assay to lay the ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic

Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity,https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1791,Commercial and Philosophical Views,Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity,"One might think that, once we know something is computable, how efficiently
it can be computed is a practical question with little further philosophical
importance. In this essay, I offer a detailed case that one would be wrong. In
particular, I argue that computational complexity theory -- the field that
studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve
computational problems -- leads to new perspectives on the nature of
mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of
logical omniscience, Hume's problem of induction, Goodman's grue riddle, the
foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, closed timelike curves,
and several other topics of philosophical interest. I end by discussing aspects
of complexity theory itself that could benefit from philosophical analysis.",Scott Aaronson,arXiv,"cs.CC, quant-ph"
lambeq: An Efficient High-Level Python Library for Quantum NLP,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04236,Natural Language Processing & Quantum Computing,lambeq: An Efficient High-Level Python Library for Quantum NLP,"We present lambeq, the first high-level Python library for Quantum Natural
Language Processing (QNLP). The open-source toolkit offers a detailed hierarchy
of modules and classes implementing all stages of a pipeline for converting
sentences to string diagrams, tensor networks, and quantum circuits ready to be
used on a quantum computer. lambeq supports syntactic parsing, rewriting and
simplification of string diagrams, ansatz creation and manipulation, as well as
a number of compositional models for preparing quantum-friendly representations
of sentences, employing various degrees of syntax sensitivity. We present the
generic architecture and describe the most important modules in detail,
demonstrating the usage with illustrative examples. Further, we test the
toolkit in practice by using it to perform a number of experiments on simple
NLP tasks, implementing both classical and quantum pipelines.","Dimitri Kartsaklis, Ian Fan, Richie Yeung, Anna Pearson, Robin Lorenz, Alexis Toumi, Giovanni de Felice, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis, Stephen Clark, Bob Coecke",arXiv,"cs.CL, cs.AI, quant-ph"
